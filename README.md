#RestTest, an demo using RestKit on iOS

This project uses RestKit do demo object mapping of user objects, it works with the my other repo RestKitServer.

To open the project, simply double click the RestTest.xcworkspace file. (It won't work if you try to open using the .xcproj file)

There are comments in the project that explain basically what is going on.
